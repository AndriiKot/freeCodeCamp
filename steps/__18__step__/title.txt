Step  18

To match specific characters in 
a string, you can use Regular Expressions 
or "regex" for short.
Regex in JavaScript is 
indicated by a pattern wrapped in forward 
slashes. The following example will match the 
string literal "hello":
Example Codeconst regex = /hello/;

Declare 
a regex variable and assign it the 
value from the example above. In future 
steps, you will update this regex pattern 
to match specific characters needed for the 
calorie counter.
