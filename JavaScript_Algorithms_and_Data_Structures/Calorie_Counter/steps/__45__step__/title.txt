Step  45

Each entry will have a 
text input for the entry's name, and 
a number input for the calories. To 
get a count of the number of 
entries, you can query by text inputs.
Pass 
the string input[type="text"] to the querySelectorAll() method. 
Remember that if you use single quotes 
for your string, you must also use 
double quotes within it (or vice-versa).
This will 
return a NodeList of all the text 
inputs in the form. You can then 
access the length property of the NodeList 
to get the number of entries. Do 
this on the same line.
