Step  53

In the Role Playing Game 
project, you learned how to set a 
button's behavior by editing its onclick property. 
You can also edit an element's behavior 
by adding an event listener.
The following example 
uses the addEventListener method to add a 
click event to a button. When the 
button is clicked, the printName function is 
called.
Example Code&lt;button class="btn"&gt;Print name&lt;/button&gt;

Example Codeconst button = 
document.querySelector('.btn');
function printName() {
  console.log("Jessica");
}
button.addEventListener('click', printName);

The addEventListener 
method takes two arguments. The first is 
the event to listen to. (Ex. 'click') 
The second is the callback function, or 
the function that runs when the event 
is triggered.
Call the .addEventListener() method on the 
addEntryButton. Pass in the string "click" for 
the first argument and the addEntry function 
for the second argument.
Note that you should 
not call addEntry, but pass the variable 
(or function reference) directly.
