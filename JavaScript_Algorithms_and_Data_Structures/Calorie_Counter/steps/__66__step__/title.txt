Step  66

Remember that return ends the 
execution of a function. After your if 
block, you need to handle the logic 
for when the input is valid. Because 
your if statement returns a value, you 
do not need an else statement.
Use the 
addition assignment operator to add currVal to 
your calories total. You'll need to use 
the Number constructor to convert currVal to 
a number.
The Number constructor is a function 
that converts a value to a number. 
If the value cannot be converted, it 
returns NaN which stands for "Not a 
Number".
Here is an example:
Example CodeNumber('10'); // returns 
the number 10
Number('abc'); // returns NaN
