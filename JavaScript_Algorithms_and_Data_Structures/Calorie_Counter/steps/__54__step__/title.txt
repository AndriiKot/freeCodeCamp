Step  54

Try adding a couple of 
entries to the Breakfast category, and you 
may notice some bugs! The first thing 
we need to fix is the entry 
counts â€“ the first entry should have 
a count of 1, not 0.
This bug 
occurs because you are querying for input[type="text"] 
elements before adding the new entry to 
the page. To fix this, update your 
entryNumber variable to be the value of 
the length of the query plus 1. 
Add this on your declaration line, not 
in your template strings.
