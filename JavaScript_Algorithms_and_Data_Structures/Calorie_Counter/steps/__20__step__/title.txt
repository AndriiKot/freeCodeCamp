Step  20

The current pattern will match 
the exact text "hello", which is not 
the desired behavior. Instead, you want to 
search for +, -, or spaces. Replace 
the pattern in your regex variable with 
\+- to match plus and minus characters.
Note 
that you need to use the backslash 
\ character to escape the + symbol 
because it has a special meaning in 
regular expressions.
