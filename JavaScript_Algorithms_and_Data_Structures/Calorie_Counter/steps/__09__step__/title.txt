Step  9

In your span element, create 
a label element for an entry-dropdown and 
give it the text Add food or 
exercise:. Then create a select element with 
the id set to entry-dropdown and a 
name set to options. Below that, add 
a button element with the id set 
to add-entry and the text Add Entry.
Give 
your button element a type attribute set 
to button to prevent automatic form submission.
