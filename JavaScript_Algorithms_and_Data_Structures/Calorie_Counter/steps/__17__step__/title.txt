Step  17

In programming, prefixing a variable 
with is or has is a common 
practice to signify that the variable represents 
a boolean value.
Here are a few examples:
Example 
Codelet isRunning = true;
let hasCompleted = false;

Declare 
a variable named isError using let and 
initialize it with false, allowing for its 
reassignment later.
Later on in the project, you 
will update the value of isError if 
the user provides an invalid input.
