Step  23

Regex can also take specific 
flags to alter the pattern matching behavior. 
Flags are added after the closing /. 
The g flag, which stands for "global", 
will tell the pattern to continue looking 
after it has found a match. Here 
is an example:
Example Codeconst helloRegex = /hello/g;

Add 
the g flag to your regex pattern.
