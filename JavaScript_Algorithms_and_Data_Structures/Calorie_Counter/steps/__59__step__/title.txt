Step  59

The list parameter is going 
to be the result of a query 
selector, which will return a NodeList. A 
NodeList is a list of elements like 
an array. It contains the elements that 
match the query selector. You will need 
to loop through these elements in the 
list.
In previous steps, you learned how to 
loop through an array using a for 
loop. You can also use a for...of 
loop to loop through an array and 
a NodeList.
A for...of loop is used to 
iterate over elements in an iterable object 
like an array. The variable declared in 
the loop represents the current element being 
iterated over.
Example Codefor (const element of elementArray) 
{
  console.log(element);
}

Create a for...of loop that 
loops through the list. For the loop's 
variable name, use const to declare a 
variable called item.
