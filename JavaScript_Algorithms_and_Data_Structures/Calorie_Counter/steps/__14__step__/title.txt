Step  14

It is time to start 
writing the script that makes your form 
work.
To access an HTML element with a 
given id name, you can use the 
getElementById() method. Here's an example of how 
to use this method:
Example Code&lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Main title&lt;/h1&gt;

Example 
Codeconst mainTitleElement = document.getElementById('title');

Begin by getting the 
form element (using the id) and storing 
it in a variable called calorieCounter.
