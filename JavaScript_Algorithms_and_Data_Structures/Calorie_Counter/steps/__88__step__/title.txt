Step  88

Finally, you need to make 
the #output element visible so the user 
can see your text. Your output variable 
is an Element, which has a classList 
property. This property has a .remove() method, 
which accepts a string representing the class 
to remove from the element.
Example Codeconst paragraphElement 
= document.getElementById('paragraph');
paragraphElement.classList.remove('hide');

Use the .remove() method of the 
output variable's classList property to remove the 
hide class. Don't forget to place the 
word hide inside quotes.
