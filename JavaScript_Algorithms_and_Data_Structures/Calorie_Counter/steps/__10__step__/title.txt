Step  10

Your select menu needs options 
for each of the food and exercise 
fieldset elements you created in the previous 
steps. Use the option element to create 
a new option for each fieldset. The 
value attribute of each option should be 
the id of the fieldset, and the 
text of each option should be the 
text of the legend.
Set the Breakfast option 
as the selected option.
