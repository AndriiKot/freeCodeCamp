Step  76

You also need to get 
the value of your #budget input. You 
already queried this at the top of 
your code, and set it to the 
budgetNumberInput variable. However, you used getElementById, which 
returns an Element, not a NodeList.
A NodeList 
is an array-like object, which means you 
can iterate through it and it shares 
some common methods with an array. For 
your getCaloriesFromInputs function, an array will work 
for the argument just as well as 
a NodeList does.
Declare a budgetCalories variable and 
set it to the result of calling 
getCaloriesFromInputs â€“ pass an array containing your 
budgetNumberInput as the argument.
