Step  44

You will want to number 
the entries a user adds. To get 
all of the number inputs, you can 
use the querySelectorAll() method.
The querySelectorAll() method returns 
a NodeList of all the elements that 
match the selector. A NodeList is an 
array-like object, so you can access the 
elements using bracket notation.
Declare an entryNumber variable 
and give it the value of targetInputContainer.querySelectorAll(). 
You do not need to pass an 
argument to the query selector yet.
