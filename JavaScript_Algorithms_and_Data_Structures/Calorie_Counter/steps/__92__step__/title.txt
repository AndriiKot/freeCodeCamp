Step  92

Remember that document.querySelectorAll returns a 
NodeList, which is array-like but is not 
an array. However, the Array object has 
a .from() method that accepts an array-like 
and returns an array. This is helpful 
when you want access to more robust 
array methods, which you will learn about 
in a future project.
The following example takes 
a NodeList of li elements and converts 
it to an array of li elements:
Example 
Code&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List 2&lt;/li&gt;
 
 &lt;li&gt;List 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Example Codeconst listItemsArray = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('li'));

console.log(listItemsArray); 
//Output: (3) [li, li, li]

Wrap your inputContainers 
query selector in Array.from(). Do this on 
the same line as your declaration.
