Step  30

The e in a number 
input can also be an uppercase E. 
Regex has a flag for this, however 
â€“ the i flag, which stands for 
"insensitive".
Example Code/Hello/i

The regex above would match hello, 
Hello, HELLO, and even hElLo because of 
the i flag. This flag makes your 
pattern case-insensitive.
Add the i flag to your 
regex pattern.
