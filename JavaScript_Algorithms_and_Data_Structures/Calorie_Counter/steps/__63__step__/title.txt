Step  63

Remember that your isInvalidInput function 
returns String.match, which is an array of 
matches or null if no matches are 
found.
In JavaScript, values can either be truthy 
or falsy. A value is truthy if 
it evaluates to true when converted to 
a Boolean. A value is falsy if 
it evaluates to false when converted to 
a Boolean. null is an example of 
a falsy value.
You need to check if 
invalidInputMatch is truthy â€“ you can do 
this by passing the variable directly to 
your if condition (without a comparison operator). 
Here's an example of checking the truthiness 
of helloWorld.
Example Codeif (helloWorld) {

}

Add an if 
statement that checks if invalidInputMatch is truthy.
