Step  37

When you open the console, 
you should see the result of null. 
The match method returns null when no 
match is found. In this case, the 
isInvalidInput function should return null when the 
input is a valid number without any 
scientific notation.
null in JavaScript is a special 
primitive that represents the intentional absence of 
a value. In a boolean context, null 
is considered falsy which evaluates to false 
in a conditional statement.
Now that you have 
finished testing your isInvalidInput function, you can 
remove the console.log statement.
