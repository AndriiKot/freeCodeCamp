Step 1

In this project, you'll learn 
to create a calorie counter 
form that enables users to input 
their daily calorie budget and 
the calorie counts of various meals. 
The form will then calculate and display 
whether the user is in a calorie deficit or surplus.

You have been provided with boilerplate CSS and HTML. 
However, you need to build your calorie counter form.

Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS, 
then add a form element and 
give it an id set to calorie-counter.
