Step  80

You need to know if 
the user is in a caloric surplus 
or deficit. A caloric surplus is when 
you consume more calories than you burn, 
and a caloric deficit is when you 
burn more calories than you consume. Burning 
as many calories as you consume is 
called maintenance, and can be thought of 
as a surplus or deficit of 0, 
depending on your goals.
Declare a surplusOrDeficit variable. 
Then use a ternary operator to set 
surplusOrDeficit to the string "Surplus" or "Deficit" 
depending on whether remainingCalories is less than 
0. If it is less than 0, 
then surplusOrDeficit should be "Surplus". Otherwise, it 
should be "Deficit".
