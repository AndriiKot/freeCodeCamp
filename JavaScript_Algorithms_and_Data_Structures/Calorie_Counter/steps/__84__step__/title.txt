Step  84

When the user has a 
calorie surplus, the remainingCalories value will be 
negative. You don't want to display a 
negative number in the result string.
Math.abs() is 
a built-in JavaScript method that will return 
the absolute value of a number.
Example Codeconst 
num = -5;
Math.abs(num); // 5

In your span 
text, wrap your remainingCalories reference in Math.abs() 
to ensure that the value is positive.
