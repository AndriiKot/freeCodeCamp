Step  38

Now you need to retrieve 
the value of entryDropdown.value to get the 
currently selected option from the dropdown.
Print entryDropdown.value 
to the console to see its value.
Since 
entryDropdown.value is in a static context (outside 
of an event listener), it only shows 
the value at the moment the code 
runs. This means it won't automatically update 
as the user interacts with the dropdown.
It 
will capture the initial value (in this 
case, "breakfast") and won't reflect any changes 
the user makes afterward.
