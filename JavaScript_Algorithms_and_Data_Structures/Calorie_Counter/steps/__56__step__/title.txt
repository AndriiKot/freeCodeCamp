The insertAdjacentHtml method takes two 
arguments. The first argument is a string 
that specifies the position of the inserted 
element. The second argument is a string 
containing the HTML to be inserted.

first argument, pass the string "beforeend" to 
insert the new element as the last 
child of targetInputContainer.
For the second argument, pass 
your HTMLString variable.
