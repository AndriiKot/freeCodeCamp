Step 1
CamperBot is trying to build out 
a random background color changer. 
But they keep running into 
issues and need your help to debug the code.

CamperBot has already added 
the HTML and CSS for the project. 
But they are confused as to why 
none of the styles and content is showing up on the page.

When they open up the console they see this message:

Example Code
SyntaxError: unknown: Unexpected token, expected "," (5:2)
Syntax errors are thrown when 
the JavaScript engine encounters something 
it can't interpret. In this case, 
it looks like CamperBot has syntax 
errors in the darkColorsArr array.

Fix the syntax errors in 
the darkColorsArr array and you 
should see the content and styles show up on the page.
