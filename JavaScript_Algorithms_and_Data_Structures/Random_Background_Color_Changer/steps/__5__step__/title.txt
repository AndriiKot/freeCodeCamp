Step 5
CamperBot has created a new variable 
called bgHexCodeSpanElement to 
store the reference to the span 
element with the id of bg-hex-code. 
However, when they try to 
log that variable to the console, 
they get null.

null is a special value in JavaScript 
that represents the absence of a value. 
This can happen when you try 
to access a property of an object that doesn't exist.

In this case, CamperBot is not 
passing in the correct 
selector to the document.querySelector method.

Fix the document.querySelector("bg-hex-code") 
line so that it correctly selects 
the element with the id of bg-hex-code.
