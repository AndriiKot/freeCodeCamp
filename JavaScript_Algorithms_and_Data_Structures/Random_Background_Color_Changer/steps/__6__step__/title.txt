Step 6
CamperBot has now created a function
called changeBackgroundColor that changes
the background color of the page to a random color
from the darkColorsArr array.
The function also displays the hex code for that new color.

When they try to test out this function,
they notice that the background
color is not changing and the text shows the following:

Example Code
Hex Code: undefined
undefined is showing up here because
the color variable is not being set correctly.

Fix the error in the darkColorsArr[getRandomIndex]
line so that the color variable is set to a random color
from the darkColorsArr array.
