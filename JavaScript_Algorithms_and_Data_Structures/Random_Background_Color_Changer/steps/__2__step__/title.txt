Step 2
Now, CamperBot is trying to create 
a function that will return a random 
index from the darkColorsArr. 
But they have run into the following error message:

Example Code
Uncaught ReferenceError: math is not defined
A ReferenceError is thrown when 
a non-existent variable is referenced. 
In this case, it looks like CamperBot 
is trying to use math but JavaScript doesn't have a math object.

Fix CamperBot's error in the math.random() 
line and open up the console again.
