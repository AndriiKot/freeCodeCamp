Step 4
CamperBot is finished with 
building out the getRandomIndex 
function and it is working as expected.

But now they are running into 
this issue when trying to create 
a reference to the body element in the DOM:

Example Code

Uncaught TypeError: document.queryselector 
is not a function
A TypeError means that the 
code is trying to perform 
an operation on a value that 
is not of the expected type.

Fix the TypeError by updating 
the document.queryselector method 
to the correct method name 
that selects an element from the DOM.
