Step 3
Now that the ReferenceError 
is resolved, the console is 
displaying the correct results 
for a random number between 0 and 9. 
But CamperBot was not expecting to see decimal numbers like these:

Example Code
0.015882899879771095
2.114596286197641
6.040964780197666
Update the console statement to print a whole number between 0 and 9.

Remember that you worked with a method 
in the Role Playing Game that 
rounds a number down to the nearest whole number.
