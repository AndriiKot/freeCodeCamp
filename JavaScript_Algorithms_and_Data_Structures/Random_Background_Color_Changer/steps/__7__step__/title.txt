Step 7
CamperBot is trying to create 
a new variable called btn to store 
the reference to the button 
element with the id of click-btn

However, when they try to log 
the button element to the console, 
they see that the button element is null.

Open up the index.html to see 
the correct id name for that button element.

Then fix the error for 
the document.querySelector("#click-btn"); line.
