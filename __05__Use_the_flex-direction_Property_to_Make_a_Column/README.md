# Use the flex-direction Property to Make a Column

The last two challenges used the *flex-direction*
property set to *row*. This property can also 
create a column by vertically stacking the children 
of a flex container.

Add the CSS property *flex-direction*
to the *#box-container* element, 
and give it a value of *column*.
