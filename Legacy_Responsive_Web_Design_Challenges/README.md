In this Responsive Web Design Certification, 
you'll learn the languages that developers use 
to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics 
of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques 
like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best 
practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond 
to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card 
with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.
